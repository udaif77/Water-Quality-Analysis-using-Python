# Water-Quality-Analysis-using-Python
• Demonstrated strong data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization skills, resulting in accurate predictions
of water quality categories and potential identification of polluted water sources from a data set of 3200+ water samples
• Conducted exploratory data analysis by plotting histograms of features and inferred that all features showed normal gaussian
distribution with significant shift w.r.t potability depicting correlation of features on potability that was biologically explained
• ML models such as Extra Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, QDA Classifier, LDA Classifier, Adaboost, Logistic Regression
were tested on train dataset and found that Extra Tree Classifier outperformed all other method with more accuracy
